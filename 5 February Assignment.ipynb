For example, a car is an object, it has a make, model, year, color, etc. (state) and can start, stop, drive, etc. (behavior). In OOP, an object is created from a class and is given its own state and behavior."

    "Ans. The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the complexity of a system and displaying only the essential features to the user. It is the ability to focus on the essential features of an object and ignore the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the technique of wrapping data and functions within an object, making it a self-contained unit. It provides a layer of protection for the data, making it inaccessible to the outside world, and ensures that the data is manipulated only through the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism of creating new classes from existing classes. The new class inherits all the properties and behaviors of the existing class and can add new properties and behaviors to them. This allows for code reusability and helps to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class. This enables the creation of flexible and reusable code, as the same method can be used for objects of different classes."
