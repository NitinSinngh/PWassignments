    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to store and retrieve complex hierarchical data structures. MongoDB is designed for scalability, high availability, and performance, and is widely used for a variety of applications, including web, mobile, and IoT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational data model that SQL databases use. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases. They are generally designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and offer high scalability, performance, and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of MongoDB over SQL databases is its flexibility in handling unstructured data. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which can be nested and can have arrays, making it easy to store complex hierarchical data structures. This is in contrast to SQL databases, which store data in tables with predefined columns and data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of MongoDB is its scalability and performance. MongoDB uses a distributed architecture that allows it to scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads. MongoDB also supports indexing, sharding, and replication, which can improve performance and ensure high availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is generally preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There is a need to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "2. There is a need for high scalability and performance, such as in web and mobile applications.\n",
    "3. There is a need for flexibility in the data model, as MongoDB's document-oriented data model can accommodate changes in the data structure more easily than SQL databases.\n",
    "4. There is a need for rapid application development, as MongoDB's flexible schema and agile development methodologies can speed up development cycles."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that offers a range of features for managing and storing data. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document-oriented data model: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easy to store and retrieve complex hierarchical data structures. This allows for faster development and easier data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic schema: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for changes in the data model without requiring a pre-defined schema upfront. This makes it easier to evolve and adapt the data model as application requirements change.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Scalability: MongoDB's distributed architecture allows it to scale horizontally across multiple servers, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. High availability: MongoDB supports replication and automatic failover, ensuring high availability and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance: MongoDB uses memory-mapped files and supports indexing, sharding, and aggregation pipelines, which can improve query performance and throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Flexibility: MongoDB supports a range of data types and indexing options, making it suitable for a variety of applications and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Security: MongoDB offers various security features, such as authentication, encryption, and access control, to ensure the security of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, allowing for flexible querying of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Aggregation pipeline: MongoDB's aggregation pipeline allows for complex data transformations and aggregations, making it easy to perform complex analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Geospatial queries: MongoDB supports geospatial queries, allowing for location-based data to be easily queried and analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB is a feature-rich database that offers flexibility, scalability, and performance for a variety of applications and data structures."
