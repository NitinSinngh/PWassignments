    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A database is a structured collection of data that can be stored, organized, and accessed electronically. It is designed to efficiently manage and retrieve information for a wide range of purposes, from managing customer information for a business to storing scientific research data. Databases can be as simple as a single table or as complex as a large collection of tables with relationships and constraints between them. Some common examples of databases include relational databases, document-oriented databases, key-value stores, and graph databases. Databases are used in many applications, from websites and mobile apps to enterprise systems and scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of database management systems that differ in their architecture, data model, and query language.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with pre-defined columns and relationships between them. They use SQL as their primary query language for retrieving and manipulating data. Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, and graphs. They are designed to be more flexible and scalable than SQL databases, making them a good fit for applications that require the storage of large amounts of unstructured data. Some examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL databases are relational, while NoSQL databases are non-relational.\n",
    "2. SQL databases use a fixed schema, while NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema.\n",
    "3. SQL databases use SQL as their primary query language, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages depending on their data model.\n",
    "4. SQL databases are best suited for applications with structured data, while NoSQL databases are better suited for applications with unstructured or semi-structured data."

    "Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "Ans. DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, constraints, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL statements are used to define the structure of the database and its objects, including the data types of columns, relationships between tables, constraints, and permissions. These statements are executed only by database administrators or users with the necessary privileges to make changes to the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common DDL statements include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE TABLE: used to create a new table in the database.\n",
    "2. ALTER TABLE: used to modify the structure of an existing table, such as adding or dropping a column or constraint.\n",
    "3. DROP TABLE: used to delete a table from the database.\n",
    "4. CREATE INDEX: used to create an index on a table to speed up queries.\n",
    "5. CREATE VIEW: used to create a virtual table that displays a subset of data from one or more tables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By using DDL commands, database administrators can create and manage the database schema, ensuring that it is consistent and optimized for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.\n",

    "Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 1) Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each row is unique. The primary key is defined when the table is created and can be used to reference the table from other tables in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have a table called \"Customers\" with columns for ID, name, and email address. You can define the \"ID\" column as the primary key for the table. This ensures that each row in the table has a unique ID value, and that the ID value cannot be null.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database. The foreign key column in one table must have the same data type as the primary key column in the other table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have another table called \"Orders\" with columns for OrderID, CustomerID, and OrderDate. You can define the \"CustomerID\" column in the \"Orders\" table as a foreign key that references the \"ID\" column in the \"Customers\" table. This creates a relationship between the two tables, where each order is associated with a specific customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a foreign key is defined, it ensures that data in the child table (the table with the foreign key) is consistent with the data in the parent table (the table with the primary key). This means that if you try to insert a value into the foreign key column that does not exist in the primary key column, the database will return an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, primary keys and foreign keys are essential for establishing relationships between tables in a relational database. The primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table, while the foreign key references the primary key of another table. These keys ensure data integrity and consistency across the database."
