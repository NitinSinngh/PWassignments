    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. There are several methods used for web scraping, ranging from manual techniques to automated software tools. Some of the most common methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual scraping: This involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or other document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regular expressions: Regular expressions can be used to search for and extract specific patterns of data from HTML or other web page source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Parsing HTML: This involves parsing the HTML code of a web page using programming languages like Python or PHP, and then extracting the relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Web scraping software: There are various web scraping software tools available that can automatically extract data from websites. Some of the popular web scraping software include Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. APIs: Many websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow users to access their data in a structured format, without having to scrape the website."

    "Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is commonly used for web scraping. It provides a set of tools for parsing HTML and XML documents, and extracting relevant data from them. Beautiful Soup makes it easy to navigate through the structure of a web page's HTML, and extract specific elements of data, such as links, text, and images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping because it simplifies the process of parsing and extracting data from web pages. It can handle poorly formatted HTML and XML documents, and is flexible enough to work with various web scraping use cases. Here are some of the key benefits of using Beautiful Soup for web scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ease of use: Beautiful Soup provides a simple and easy-to-use API for navigating and extracting data from web pages. Its syntax is intuitive and easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners and advanced users alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility: Beautiful Soup can be used to extract data from various types of web pages, including dynamic and JavaScript-driven pages. It also works with various parsers, such as lxml and html5lib, which can handle different types of HTML and XML documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Robustness: Beautiful Soup can handle poorly formatted HTML and XML documents, and can gracefully handle errors and exceptions during the web scraping process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Beautiful Soup is a powerful and widely used tool for web scraping in Python, and is recommended for anyone looking to extract data from web pages."

    "Q4. Why is flask used in this Web Scraping project?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that is often used for building web applications and APIs. In the context of a web scraping project, Flask can be used to create a simple web interface for running and displaying the results of a web scraping script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the benefits of using Flask in a web scraping project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy to set up: Flask is easy to install and set up, making it a good choice for small web scraping projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework, which means it has a small footprint and minimal dependencies. This makes it easy to deploy and maintain, even on low-powered servers or virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexible: Flask is a flexible framework that can be used to build a wide range of web applications, from simple APIs to full-fledged web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simple syntax: Flask has a simple and intuitive syntax, which makes it easy to learn and use, especially for those who are new to web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a web scraping project, Flask can be used to create a simple web interface that allows users to input parameters, such as search terms or URLs, and display the results of the web scraping script. This can be useful for making the results of the web scraping project more accessible to non-technical stakeholders, or for making it easier to share the results of the project with others."
